# Add User List
This is a React application that allows users to add names to a list. It demonstrates the use of React Fragments, React Portals, React events, refs, the useState hook, styling React components, inline styling, CSS modules, and working with React components.
## Features
- **React Fragments**: The component uses React Fragments to wrap multiple elements in a single parent element, without adding an extra node to the DOM.
- **React Portals**: The component uses React Portals to render an element to a different part of the DOM, outside of its parent component.
- **React events**: The component uses React events, such as onClick, onSubmit, and onChange, to handle user interactions.
- `Refs`: The component uses refs to access DOM elements and manipulate their values.
- `useState hook`: The component uses the useState hook to store and update data in response to user interactions.
- **Styling React components**: The component uses various techniques to style React components, including inline styles, CSS classes, and CSS modules.
- Working with React components: The component demonstrates how to work with React components, including rendering, props, state, and lifecycle methods.
